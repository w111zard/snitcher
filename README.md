# Snitcher

This is an example project!
I wrote this while I'm studying book *Node.js Design Patterns*
This program demonstrates different async control flow using callbacks
(sequential iteration, parallel execution, limited parallel execution)

# Installation

```sh
$ npm ci
$ npm i -g
```

# Usage

+ Create file containing links you want to process

```sh
$ snitcher -h
$ snitcher file_with_links
```
